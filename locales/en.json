You'll only need to cover the price difference between the two! Here's how it works: the gap between our Basic and Professional Plans is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). So, you would simply pay this $1500 difference to upgrade from the Basic to the Professional Plan. This convenient policy also applies when you're upgrading from the Basic to the Enterprise Plan, or from any other plan to a higher one. Just remember, you'll only be paying the difference between the two plan costs, not the entire cost of the new plan. Your upgrade just got a whole lot simpler!"
